# Homework (and alternatives to homework)

## Discussion - Assessment in 218

## Grading

- You don't have to grade 100% of every assignment

- Explorations: Pick 2 important ?s to grade, everything else is completion



# How Writing Fits In

- Writing To Learn    
Writing forces students to think in a way that working problems doesn't

- If you understand something well, you can explain it

- (Some classes) Writing "why" for each step of the process
    - May not work as well in 218
