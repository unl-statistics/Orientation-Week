# Important Concepts

# Discussion

## What concepts did you select?


## Official Topic List


# [Data Vis Article](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/10691898.2020.1796399)

## Writing Activity

What were your initial thoughts about the data vis article? Write for a few minutes about what you took away from this article.


## Writing and Statistics

 As you go through Stat 218, you will gain a deeper understanding of elementary statistics (any statistics) through teaching it. The same is true for the students - they gain a deeper understanding of Stat 218 by writing about the concepts.
 
## Writing Activity

Write for a few minutes about what kinds of alternative assessments you think work well in Stat 218. Maybe it's an assessment you experienced as a student?

## Student Expectations

Students often come into Stat 218 assuming that it will be a "math" class and are sometimes angry/confused to find that it is not. Writing (from the very beginning) and emphasizing inference from the start of the class are two ways to make clear to the students that statistics is not math.

## Writing Activity

Write for a few minutes about how you think the Stat 218 class can be structured to make clear to the students that statistics is not math.

## Low-Stakes Writing

Each exercise had different goals!

-   Activity 1: Writing to probe a subject - to get you to think about the article

-   Activity 2/3: Tools to gauge understanding and guide future discussion

How can you incorporate writing into other things (assessments, activities, important concepts) we'll discuss this week?
