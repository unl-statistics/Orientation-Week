# Services for Students with Disabilities (SSD)

## Services for Students with Disabilities {.smaller}

The University strives to make all learning experiences as accessible as possible. If you anticipate or experience barriers based on your disability (including mental health, chronic or temporary medical conditions), please let me know immediately so that we can discuss options privately. To establish reasonable accommodations, I may request that you register with Services for Students with Disabilities (SSD). If you are eligible for services and register with their office, make arrangements with me as soon as possible to discuss your accommodations so they can be implemented in a timely manner.
SSD contact information: 117 Louise Pound Hall Bldg.; 402-472-3787


## How Students Register for Accommodations

1. Complete the [SSD Application for Services](https://go.unl.edu/ssdapplication)
2. Provide documentation from healthcare provider
3. SSD will contact you to schedule an appointment

## How Students Request Test Accommodations {.smaller}

1. Students contact SSD for an updated copy of their plan.
2. Students make an appointment with each of their instructors and share a copy of their Accommodation Plan.  Students must be present and available to answer questions at this meeting.
3. Students clarify with their instructor(s) about their exams and where they will be taken. Instructors decide where exams are administered.
4. For paper exams and quizzes, instructors complete the SSD Instructor Exam Proctor Form (Link has been added to the student accommodation plan.) 
    - The instructor will identify where the student will take paper exams (at SSD testing center or a location provided by the instructor).  
    - It is the student's responsibility to discuss scheduling conflicts with their instructor in advance.  
    - Student exams may need to be scheduled at alternative times so a student does not miss other classes.

5. Once the proctor form is completed, a copy will be sent to SSD, the instructor and the student.  If the instructor wants student exams proctored at SSD, the student will report to SSD testing center on the scheduled days and times. 
6. If exams are online, no additional information is needed by SSD. The instructor extends the time.

# Academic Honesty Policy {.smaller}

As a student at the University of Nebraska, you are a member of an academic community in which academic integrity and responsible conduct are essential for the community to function. To ensure all that students know what is expected of them, the University has adopted Standards of Academic Integrity and Responsible Conduct. You can find the University-wide standards for academic integrity and responsible conduct online. Your instructor may have specified on their syllabus additional expectations and consequences for academic dishonesty that apply to their class.

# Diversity & Inclusiveness {.smaller}
UNL values diversity in the broadest sense â€“ gender, age, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, economic status, physical and intellectual ability, religion, education and geography. We believe that acknowledging, building understanding and incorporating diversity throughout the curriculum will best prepare you for a career in a global society. The inclusive learning environment we seek to foster is one where diverse perspectives are recognized and respected, and therefore conversations within your course must be civil and respectful of individual ideas, experiences, and beliefs that may be different from your own. To challenge ideas or beliefs in a manner that is considerate of the individual expressing them is encouraged, but disrespect or hostility toward any person is not acceptable behavior in the classroom. According to our Student Code of Conduct, speech that is abusive, harassing, intimidating, or coercive is prohibited. Students who engage in such speech will be asked to leave the classroom and further disciplinary actions may be taken.
