Write for a few minutes about what you took away from this article.\n\nThink/pair/share group discussion\n\nWhy writing is integral to statistics\nAs you go through Stat 218, you will gain a deeper understanding of elementary statistics (any statistics) through teaching it. The same is true for the students - they gain a deeper understanding of Stat 218 by writing about the concepts.\nWriting Activity:\nWrite for a few minutes about what kinds of alternative assessments you think work well in Stat 218. Maybe it’s an assessment you experienced as a student?\n\nThink/pair/share group discussion\n\nStudents often come into Stat 218 assuming that it will be a “math” class and are sometimes angry/confused to find that it is not. Writing (from the very beginning) and emphasizing inference from the start of the class are two ways to make clear to the students that statistics is not math.\nWriting Activity:\nWrite for a few minutes about how you think the Stat 218 class can be structured to make clear to the students that statistics is not math.\n\nThink/pair/share group discussion\n\nAll of these writing exercises are examples of low stakes writing. Each exercise had different goals!\n\nActivity 1: Writing to probe a subject - to get you to think about the article\nActivity 2/3: Tools to gauge understanding and guide future discussion\n\nThink about how to incorporate writing into other things we’ll discuss this week: activities, assessments, important concepts.\nIn Stat 892, we’ll discuss\n\nwriting/thinking problems - how to use student writing to gauge understanding\nlow, mid, and high stakes writing tasks\npeer review\nconstructing assignments\nassessing writing/understanding"
