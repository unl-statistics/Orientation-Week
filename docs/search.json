Students must be present and available to answer questions at this meeting.\nStudents clarify with their instructor(s) about their exams and where they will be taken. Instructors decide where exams are administered.\nFor paper exams and quizzes, instructors complete the SSD Instructor Exam Proctor Form (Link has been added to the student accommodation plan.)\n\nThe instructor will identify where the student will take paper exams (at SSD testing center or a location provided by the instructor).\n\nIt is the student’s responsibility to discuss scheduling conflicts with their instructor in advance.\n\nStudent exams may need to be scheduled at alternative times so a student does not miss other classes."
